# cm3070-computer-science-final-project

This repository is my work for the Final project course CM3070 Final Project.

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that could predict cancer cells to be benign or malign based on several characteristics of those cells.
One will use metrics like accuracy, recall and precision to evaluate the model’s adequacy to the given purpose.
The template being used is “Deep Learning on a public dataset” from CM3015 Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
